2) What is the purpose of a router in MVC and how does a MVC router on the Apache web server work?

In MVC, the router is the controller and contains all the the business logic behind how our scripts work. It is the bridge between how things are handled in the view and the actual code in the model. It can be used to update the model. For example, the router would be used for the actual logic involved in saving information to a database, accessing the database, checking to see if someone has access to certain pages, how to handle requests for accessing a certain page. It can also use a website's url to create a more dynamic request. Because the logic can typically be found on all .php documents, MVC allows you to use separate your logic from your Model and View.
