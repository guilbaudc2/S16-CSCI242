Namespaces are way for people to reuse code and to use classes that may have the same name but do different things. For example, I might be 
creating a class with the name Car. If I wanted to use someone else's Car class, I would get an error that states you cannot redefine a class
(very much like you would get with functions). Instead, I can put my Car class in a specific namespace, for example "Guilbaud", and if someone
wants to use it, they would call it with use Guilbaud\Car.php.
