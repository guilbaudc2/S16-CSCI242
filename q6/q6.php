    <li>Encapsulation - Encapsulation is way for programmers to prevent others from tampering with attributes and methods. There are three levels of encapsulation: public, private, and protected. Public methods and attributes
        can be used and manipulated by any one, not ideal if you have sensitive data. Private methods and attributes are the exact opposite. Nothing and no one can change the values of your methods and attributes. Protected is
        in the middle. Protected methods and attributes can be used by parent and child classes.
    </li>


    <li>Inheritance - Inheritance relates to properties, charateristics and traits that one class has that's passed down to a child class. Like in genetics, dogs, humans, cats, and dolphins are all mammals, and there are certain 
    charateristics that are the same across all mammals. We have eyes. We are vertabrates. We eat. In programming, it's a way for you to pass on attributes and methods to related classes.
    </li>

    <li>Interfaces - Interfaces are a way to specify methods that must be used. While you can't specify code in it, you can do things like Type Hinting to show what type of code you're expecting in there. Although it is similar to
        abstraction, interfaces are used on classes and can be implemented.
    </li>


    <li>Polymorphism - Polymorphism relates to inheritance, in that it connects the way it inherits certain charateristics from a parent class. However, there are some differences in the way that characteristic is carried out.
    For example, you can calculate the area for all shapes, but the way you calculate the area of a circle is different than the way you can with a square. There is a function related to calculating the area, but the parts of
    that function are different.

//Interfaces: must be implemented.

//Interfaces: ex: you can name several things but those things are not related to each other.
